# 🌲🔥 Forest Fire Detection Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview
Forest fires pose a significant threat to the environment, wildlife, and human lives. This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect forest fires from satellite and drone imagery, providing an early warning system for wildfire prevention and management.

## 🚀 Features
- Uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for accurate fire detection.
- Trained on real-world satellite and drone images.
- Capable of differentiating between fire, smoke, and non-fire scenarios.
- Provides real-time fire detection and alerts.
- Scalable for integration with IoT and cloud-based applications.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow/Keras** 🧠
- **OpenCV** 👀
- **NumPy & Pandas** 📊
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 📈
- **Flask/FastAPI** (for deployment) 🌍
- **Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook** (for training and testing) 💻

## 📊 Dataset
The model is trained on publicly available forest fire datasets, including:
- **NASA FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System)** 🔥
- **Kaggle Forest Fire Datasets** 📁

## 🔧 Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Forest-Fire-Detection-Deep-Learning.git
cd Forest-Fire-Detection-Deep-Learning

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training the Model
```bash
python src/train.py --epochs 20 --batch_size 32 --dataset_path data/
```

## 🔍 Detecting Fire in Images
```bash
python src/detect.py --image_path test_image.jpg
```

## 🌍 Web App Deployment
To run the web app locally:
```bash
cd app
python app.py
```
Then, open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser.

## 🎯 Future Enhancements
- Implement **real-time video fire detection**.
- Integrate **drone surveillance for early detection**.
- Deploy as a **cloud-based wildfire detection API**.
